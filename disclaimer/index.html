  <h1>üîí DNS Scan Disclaimer</h1>
  <p>
    As part of an academic and non-intrusive cybersecurity research project, we are performing
    an <strong>automated DNS scan</strong> targeting domains within the <code>.nl</code> top-level domain (TLD).
    The <strong>primary goal</strong> of this research is to identify and map subdomain structures
    exposed through DNS mechanisms. A <strong>secondary objective</strong> is to evaluate the prevalence and usage
    of <strong>DNSSEC</strong>, including <strong>NSEC</strong> and <strong>NSEC3</strong> implementations.
  </p>

  <h2>üîç Scan Details</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Type of research:</strong> DNS resolution only (no exploitation or unauthorized access)</li>
    <li><strong>Techniques:</strong> DNS queries made directly or via <em>Google Public DNS</em> (8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4)</li>
    <li><strong>Data collected:</strong> Public DNS records, including subdomains exposed via NSEC/NSEC3</li>
    <li><strong>Per-domain traffic limit:</strong> Max. 50 DNS requests per second</li>
    <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Domains under the <code>.nl</code> TLD only</li>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Increase awareness of subdomain exposure risks and DNSSEC-related privacy implications</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>‚ùì FAQ ‚Äì Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <h3>1. Is this scan harmful to my systems or infrastructure?</h3>
  <p>
    No. Only standard DNS queries are made through Google DNS. There are no penetration attempts,
    port scans, or unauthorized access attempts.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Why use Google DNS?</h3>
  <p>
    We use Google Public DNS because it provides robust caching. This significantly reduces the number of 
    duplicate queries reaching authoritative servers, minimizing load and making the scan more efficient 
    and respectful of infrastructure.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Are any personal or sensitive data collected?</h3>
  <p>
    No. Only publicly available DNS data is collected. We do not gather or process personal data
    or confidential business information.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Will the research results be published?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. Aggregated, anonymized findings will be made publicly available after the study concludes.

  </p>

  <h3>5. What are NSEC and NSEC3, and why are they relevant?</h3>
  <p>
    NSEC and NSEC3 are DNSSEC mechanisms that help prove a subdomain does not exist.
    However, depending on implementation, they may inadvertently reveal existing subdomains 
    (<em>zone walking</em>), which can present privacy and security concerns.
